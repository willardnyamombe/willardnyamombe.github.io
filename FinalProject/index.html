        <h1>Temple Inn & Suites</h1>
        <p>
          The Temple Inn & Suites is a hotel chain headquartered in Bethesda, MD
          that builds and manages specialized hotel accommodations near temple
          locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around
          the world. The owner-operated company caters to temple workers,
          patrons, and their families by providing specialized services and
          accommodations that meet the needs of those patrons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hotel accommodations and services are available to anyone willing
          to abide by the terms and policies outlined by the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The overall goal of the website project is to promote and provide
          information about the specialized services that this hotel chain
          offers to meet the needs of temple patrons who come to serve in the
          temple or who participate in events such as sealings, weddings,
          receptions, and youth trips. The website should reflect the Church
          culture and be designed to support a temple oriented theme as well as
          the concept of being a haven of comfort and accessibility.
